# Day 1

### I have finally set up the Electron + React + Typescript Environment after a few failed attempts. Today the goal is to do the following:

- [x] Create Start, Pause, Continue, and End Buttons
- [ ] Adjust Pomodoro and Break length
- [ ] Trigger sound once pomodoro is finished
- [ ] Understand code fully
- [x] Remove gray background

# Day 2 - June 1st 2025

### I'm going to have to do a couple of things. The initial problem I ran into was centering the two components and moving the Overview component to the right but that's okay, we'll leave that for later. I assume there are certain CSS classes that are overriding my newer code but that's okay. I think I'll be able to better handle that once I learn how to properly leverage CoPilot. Today I wanted to:

- [ ] Add the break feature
- [ ] Trigger a sound once the timer ends
- [ ] Save Pomos to appear under the boxes
- [ ] Update the boxes
- [ ] Make it so you can't save a Pomo under 5 minutes
- [ ] Implement a Date/Time Formatter or something idk
