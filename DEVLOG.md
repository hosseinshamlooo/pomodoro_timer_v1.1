# Day 1

### I have finally set up the Electron + React + Typescript Environment after a few failed attempts. Today the goal is to do the following:

- [ ] Toggle between timer and pomodoros
- [ ] Create Start, Pause, Continue, and End Buttons
- [ ] Adjust Pomodoro and Break length
- [ ] Trigger sound once pomodoro is finished
- [ ] Understand code fully
- [x] Remove gray background
